	<h1>Magenta Programming Language</h1>
	<p>
		Magenta is a statically typed, imperative and impure functional programming language. It draws inspiration mostly from Python and other C-family languages, and it's most closely
		related popular languages include Python and JavaScript.
	</p>

		<h3>Context</h3>
		<p>
			Magenta is the product of a collaboration between myself and James Murphy over the course of the spring semester of 2017 at UMW. Under the supervision of Dr. Ian
			Finlayson we designed the syntax and semantics of Magenta from scratch and implemented an interpreter for the language. We took on this task with the purpose of
			gaining a better understanding of how programming languages are designed and implemented. We also wanted to implement some original language features that we had 
			not seen in other languages.

		<h3>Take Aways & Lessons Learned</h3>
		<p>
			Over the course of this project, I learned quite a bit about generally applicable techniques such as lexing and parsing of text. I gained a lot of experience
			with tools designed to define strict grammars and how to use these grammars to derive meaning from written instructions. Where we fell short with Magenta was in
			our design of its type system. The type system was sort of created on the fly as we introduced new types into the language, and although it works it is not as 
			elegant as it could be. If I were to redesign Magenta from scratch, I would spend much more time up front to design a robust type system that is provably
			consistent and performant.

		<h3>Technical Description</h3>
		<p>
			The interpreter is built using C++, GNU Flex, and GNU Bison. Features include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Dynamic Typing.
			</li>
			<li>
				Built-in types including integers, floating point numbers, strings, and lists.
			</li>
			<li>
				First class functions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Robust control flow mechanisms.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The codebase be found <a href="https://github.com/taylordohmen/magenta">here</a>. Installation requires GNU Make and has been tested only on Ubuntu Linux.
			To compile the intepreter, clone the given git repository and run make.
