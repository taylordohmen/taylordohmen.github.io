I recently graduated with a PhD in computer science from the University of Colorado Boulder, where I studied under the advisement of Professor [Ashutosh Trivedi](https://ashut.bitbucket.io/).

My research interests are broadly centered around theoretical computer science, including topics related to automata theory, optimization & learning, formal logic, and computational complexity.
