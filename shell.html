	<h1>Unix Shell</h1>
	<div>
		<h3>Assignment</h3>
		<p>
			For CPSC 405 - Operating Systems at UMW one assignment is to create a shell that mimics the basic functionalities of standard unix shells such as Bash. The
			purpose of this assignment was to illustrate how processes in an operating system are managed and controlled. By implementing the program whose job it is to 
			spawn new processes, I was able to gain a deeper insight into how processes function in general as well as gaining valuable experience using C to write programs
			in the context of operating system development.
		</p>

		<h3>Take Aways & Lessons Learned</h3>
		<p>
			During the development of this shell, I learned a lot about unix processes and how they are organized within a system. I also gained some useful experience 
			programming in C and parsing text without the use of any libraries or pre-made tools. If I were to do this project again, I would want to implement additional features 
			that popular shells include such as further output redirection and command sequence operators. The notion of pipes in particular is something that would have been nice to include, as pipes
			facilitate the chaining of shell commands in very useful and intuitive ways.

		<h3>Technical Description</h3>
		<p>
			The command line interpreter is built using C only. Features include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Ability to call any available unix system calls.
			</li>
			<li>
				Output redirection.
			</li>
			<li>
				Background jobs.
			</li>
			<li>
				Batch file execution.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The codebase can be found <a href="https://github.com/taylordohmen/shell">here</a>. Installation requires GNU Make and has been tested only on Ubuntu Linux.
			To compile the intepreter, clone the given git repository and run make.
