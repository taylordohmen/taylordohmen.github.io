title: "Regular Relations of Infinite Strings"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'We introduce the computational model of nondeterministic streaming string transducers over infinite strings and prove expressive equivalence to relations of infinite strings definable in monadic second-order logic. We also establish a number of foundational results on the decidability of various problems concerning this class of relations.'
