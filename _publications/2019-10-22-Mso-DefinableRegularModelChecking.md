title: "MSO-Definable Regular Model Checking"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'Regular Model Checking (RMC) is a symbolic model checking technique where the set of system states are expressed as regular languages over strings and the transition relation is expressed using rational string-to-string relations. RMC permits verification of non-trivial properties in systems with infinite state spaces. We introduce monadic second-order logic (MSO) definable regular model checking (MSO-RMC), a framework that generalizes RMC by enabling the modeling of systems with more complex transition relations which are definable using nondeterministic MSO-definable string-to-string transformations.'
